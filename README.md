## Global Population Trend Analysis Dashboard 

## Executive Summary
This project aims to explore and analyze global population data using Python, SQL and Power BI, leveraging Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib and Power BI for visualizations. The analysis includes identifying trends and patterns, such as missing data, population distribution across continents, and changes over time. Specific tasks include determining countries with no population data, 
calculating total and average populations for regions, identifying high-growth areas, and visualizing key trends to support GLOBALTECH in making data-driven decisions.

## Task
The task involves analyzing a dataset for GLOBALTECH Ltd to answer specific questions about global population trends. required to use Python, SQL, and Power BI for the analysis.

## The report addresses the following key questions:
1. Africa-related Entries: How many entries in the database are from 
Africa?
2. Africa’s Total Population in 2010: What was the total population of 
Africa in 2010?
3. Average Population in South America (2000): What is the average 
population of countries in South America in 2000?
4. Smallest Population (2007): Which country had the smallest population 
in 2007?
5. Population Growth in Europe (2000–2010): How much has the 
population of Europe grown from 2000 to 2010?



## Tools Used
SQL: Extract and query the relevant data from the dataset.
Python: For data cleaning, transformation, and possibly verifying SQL outputs.
Power BI Desktop: for creating dynamic and interactive visualizations to present the findings effectively.

## Data Sources
United Nation population dataset with historical and projected population data by country and year.

## Key Findings
Africa’s Population in 2010:

Total population: 991 million. Major countries like Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Egypt had notably higher populations.

South America’s Average Population in 2000:
Average population: 24.5 million. Larger countries like Brazil and Argentina had above-average populations, while smaller countries like Bolivia had below-average populations.

Global Population in 2007:

China and India exceeded 1 billion people, dominating global demographics.
Europe’s Population Growth (2000–2010):

Top-growing countries: Spain, France, UK, Ireland, and Italy, with Spain adding 6 million people.
